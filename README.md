# vpython-astrophysics
Simulations made with the python package vpython, specifically in the field of astrophysics.<br>
Already working versions can be found on my website (Live Demo):
- [Planetary simulator](http://213.32.70.39/sim/universe)
- [Sun simulator](http://213.32.70.39/sim/sun)

### Description of individual modules

- universe_sim.py is a planetary orbit simulator
- sun_sim.py is a star simulator

### Goal

All the modules should be able to work together and act as an fully functional "universe simulator".
